## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning Features

### Anomaly Detection Algorithm
- **Isolation Forest**: Advanced unsupervised learning for outlier detection
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Considers all health metrics simultaneously
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves detection accuracy

### Health Scoring System
- **Weighted Metrics**: Different health parameters have appropriate weightings
- **Normalization**: All metrics scaled to 0-100 for consistent scoring
- **Real-time Calculation**: Instant updates as new data arrives

### Pattern Recognition
- **Circadian Rhythm Detection**: Identifies natural daily health patterns
- **Correlation Analysis**: Discovers relationships between different metrics
- **Trend Identification**: Recognizes long-term health trends

## 🎨 Customization

### Modifying Health Metrics
To add new health metrics, modify the `generate_sample_data()` method:

```python
# Add your new metric
new_metric = your_calculation_here
data['new_metric'] = new_metric
```

### Adjusting Anomaly Sensitivity
Change the contamination parameter in the `HealthMonitor` class:

```python
self.anomaly_detector = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)  # More sensitive
```

### Custom Styling
Modify the CSS in the `st.markdown()` sections to change colors, fonts, and layouts.

## 📊 Sample Data Generation

The application generates realistic health data with:
- **Natural circadian rhythms** for heart rate and activity
- **Realistic value ranges** for all health metrics
- **Intentional anomalies** (5% of data points) for testing detection
- **Correlated patterns** between related metrics (e.g., stress and sleep quality)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ImportError: No module named 'streamlit'**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   streamlit run health_monitor.py --server.port 8502
   ```

3. **Charts not displaying**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of Plotly installed
   - Clear your browser cache and refresh

4. **Performance issues with large datasets**
   - Reduce the number of days in data generation
   - Use the "Stop Real-time Updates" button when not needed

### Browser Compatibility
- **Recommended**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest versions)
- **Mobile**: Responsive design works on all modern mobile browsers
